# Museum From Home

>A prototype of our interactive museum desktop application

## Description

---

Museum From Home (a.k.a. CultureGame) is an interactive 3D application that
allows the user to virtually visit the museum it contains.  In the prototype
the museum is called Fundos Museum and it is a fantastic museum that we
created exclusively for the design of the prototype of the application.

The goal of the application is to facilitate and service as many social
groups (disabled, foreign speakers, etc.) as possible. In addition, we aim
to attract younger ages who in the years of continuous technology development
have lost their interest in archeological sites, museums and cultural 
heritage collections. From our research to already build similar apps a
fairly good level of knowledge and management of the software is required to
edit it. As a result, we have as a partial goal, to implement and offer the
possibility of easy editing and adding of exhibits to users with less
computational knowledge. Finally, we aim at the individual use of the 
application and its assimilation by educational institutions and museums,
ainly for teachers and indirectly for commercial and financial economists.

`Disclaimer` A lot of the 3D models and assets were not made by us. We only use them so we can have a working prototype.
